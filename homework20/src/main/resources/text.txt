Conan Doyle modeled Holmes’s methods methods and mannerisms on those of Dr. Joseph Bell, who had been his professor at the University
of Edinburgh Medical School. In particular, Holmes’s uncanny ability to gather evidence based upon his honed skills of
observation and deductive reasoning paralleled Bell’s method of diagnosing a patient’s disease. Holmes offered some insight
into his method, claiming that “When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
His detecting abilities become clear, though no less amazing, when explained by his companion, Dr. John H. Watson, who recounts
the criminal cases they jointly pursue. Although Holmes rebuffs praise, declaring his abilities to be “elementary,” the oft-quoted
phrase “Elementary, my dear Watson,” never actually appears in Conan Doyle’s writings.
